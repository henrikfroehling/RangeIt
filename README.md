RangeIt
===

---
### Status
**Contains a collection of helper methods (`Range.Ints()` and `Range.Iota()`) for generating ranges of arbitrary type and rudimentary iterator support.**

---

### ToDo

- [x] Setup Contiguous Integration (AppVeyor)
- [ ] Create NuGet package
- [ ] Add extension methods for class `Range<T>` and `Range<T, U>` to support LINQ properly

---

### Ranges

#### Ranges Usage Examples
```csharp
var intRange = Range.Ints(1, 11);
// intRange == { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 }

var strRange = Range.Iota("hello", (s) => s + "a", (s) => s?.Length == 10);
// strRange = { "hello", "helloa", "helloaa", "helloaaa", "helloaaaa", "helloaaaaa" }
```

**This are just two usage examples. There are many more overloads, especially for `Range.Iota()`.**

---

### Iterators
**Work in progress**

#### Iterators Usage Example
```csharp
var list = new List<int>(new int[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 });
var it = list.Begin();

// Looping forward
while (it++)
    Console.WriteLine(it.Current);

it = list.End();

// Looping backward
while (--it)
    Console.WriteLine(it.Current);

// second element
it = list.Begin() + 2;
it.Current = 7;

it = list.Begin();

// Using iterator like an enumerator
foreach (var val in it)
    Console.WriteLine(val);
```
