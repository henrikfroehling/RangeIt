Ranges
===

---
### Status
**Currently just a collection of helper methods (`Range.Ints()` and `Range.Iota()`) for generating ranges of arbitrary type.**

### ToDo

- [ ] Setup Contiguous Integration (AppVeyor)
- [ ] Create NuGet package
- [ ] Add extension methods for class `Range<T>` and `Range<T, U>` to support LINQ properly

### Usage Examples
```
var intRange = Range.Ints(1, 11);
// intRange == { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 }

var strRange = Range.Iota("hello", (s) => s + "a", (s) => s?.Length == 10);
// strRange = { "hello", "helloa", "helloaa", "helloaaa", "helloaaaa", "helloaaaaa" }
```

**This are just two usage examples. There are many more overloads, especially for `Range.Iota()`.**
